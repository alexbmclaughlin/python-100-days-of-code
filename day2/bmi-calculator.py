# Write a program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) from a user's weight and height.

# BMI Wikipedia Page

# The BMI is a measure of someone's weight taking into account their height. 
# e.g. If a tall person and a short person both weigh the same amount, the short person is usually more overweight.

# BMI Formula = weight / height**2

# 1st input: enter height in meters e.g: 1.65
height = input()
# 2nd input: enter weight in kilograms e.g: 72
weight = input()
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

# Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
h = float(height)
w = float(weight)

print(int(w / h ** 2))
