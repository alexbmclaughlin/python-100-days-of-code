# I was reading this article by Tim Urban - Your Life in Weeks and realised just how little time we actually have.

# Create a program using maths and f-Strings that tells us how many weeks we have left, if we live until 90 years old.

# It will take your current age as the input and output a message with our time left in this format:

# You have x weeks left.
# Where x is replaced with the actual calculated number of weeks the input age has left until age 90.

age = input()
# ğŸš¨ Don't change the code above ğŸ‘†
# Write your code below this line ğŸ‘‡

weeks = 4680
life = 52
life *= int(age)
x = weeks - life
print(f"You have {x} weeks left.")
